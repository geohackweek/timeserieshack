The **timeserieshack** project will build tools and workflows to use Google Earth Engine JavaScript API to explore climate variables & phenology.

We are developing a **workflow** which will allow any analyst to investigate climate time-series data within a designated study area (defined by a vector).

Our team is composed of:
* Keala Hagmann, UW SEFS
* Joel Masselink, Vulcan
* Christiana Ade, NC State
* Richard McGovern, UW APL
* Zhengxin Lang, UW SEFS
* Jane Yang, UW
* Catherine Kuhn, UW SEFS
* Meg Halabisky, UW SEFS
