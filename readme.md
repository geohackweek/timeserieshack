The **timeserieshack** project will build tools and workflows to use Google Earth Engine JavaScript API to explore climate variables & phenology.

We are developing a **workflow** which will allow any analyst to investigate climate time-series data within a designated study area (defined by a vector).

Our team is composed of:

* Keala Hagmann
* Joel Masselink
* Christiana Ade
* Richard McGovern
* Zhengxin Lang
* Jane Yang
* Catherine Kuhn
* Meg Halabisky
