The *timeserieshack* project will build tools and workflows to use Google Earth Engine JavaScript API to explore climate variables & phenology.

We are developing a *workflow* which will allow any analyst to investigate climate time-series data within a designated study area (defined by a vector).

Our team is composed of:
*Keala Hagmann*
*Joel Masselink*
*Christiana Ade*
*Richard McGovern*
*Zhengxin Lang*
*Jane Yang*
*Catherine Kuhn*
*Meg Halabisky*
